# INSTRUCTIONS

## Project Overview

Create a skeletion of a game PWA.

Incorporate phaserjs game engine.

App should work offline and be lean and performant.

Must run well on all screen sizes, in particular in the Amazon Fire 7 tablet.

Game UX must mimic Avatar World and Toca Boca games.

To start, create a world map that renders well at all zoom levels and respects the UX of Avatar World and Toca Boca games.

2D is fine, isometric is nice if that's what Avatar World and Toca Boca games use.

The world map should be a sandbox where players can explore and interact with the world.

The world map should have different terrains, like grass, water, sand, forest, mountains, etc.

The world maps should be an accurate representation of the world.
